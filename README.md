Twitch Streamer Status Checker

A Status Checker App that checks weather a Twitch streamer is online and broadcasting, offline or his account has been closed/does not exist. This challenge was part of the curriculum at Free Code Camp and it was one of the projects required for the Front-end development certificate. 

In this app I used JavaScript, ajax, json and the Twitch API.
